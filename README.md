# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression-Stats-Model-Assumptions-Check

It is a Supervised Machine Learning Project(Diamond Price Prediction).

In this project,we will build a model to predict the price of Diamonds, 
with the help of given features like- carat, cut, color, width, depth, etc.

We have used Linear Stats Model for Price prediction and Have also checked the Assumptions of Linear Regression.

First we will start with Basic Exploratory Data Analysis, then cleaning the data, scaling it, and then proceeding with model building.

Then, model prediction and checking the accuracy. Finally, proceeding with the Linear Assumptions Check.
